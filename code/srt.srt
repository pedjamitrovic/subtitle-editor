2
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:56,490
- Captain.
- Yes, sir?

3
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:58,656
Tell them we wish
to board at once.

4
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:01,453
With all due respect...

5
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:04,652
the ambassadors for the supreme
chancellor wish to board immediately.

6
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:06,577
<i>Yes, of course.</i>

7
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:09,658
<i>As you know,
our blockade is perfectly legal...</i>

8
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:13,693
<i>and we'd be happy
to receive the ambassadors.</i>

9
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:37,774
I'm TC-14 at your service.

10
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,697
This way, please.

11
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:48,492
We are greatly honoured
by your visit, Ambassadors.

12
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:50,417
Make yourselves comfortable.

13
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:52,770
My master
will be with you shortly.

14
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,695
I have a bad feeling about this.

15
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:01,698
- I don't sense anything.
- It's not about the mission, Master.

16
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:05,574
It's something elsewhere, elusive.

17
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,975
Don't centre on your anxieties,
Obi-Wan.

18
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:11,092
Keep your concentration here and now,
where it belongs.

19
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:13,939
But Master Yoda said
I should be mindful of the future.

20
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,971
But not at the expense
of the moment.

21
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:18,898
Be mindful of the living Force,
young Padawan.

22
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:20,851
Yes, Master.

23
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:26,450
How do you think this trade viceroy
will deal with the chancellor's demands?

24
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,616
These Federation types are cowards.

25
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:31,459
The negotiations will be short.

26
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:34,734
What? What did you say?

27
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:37,693
The ambassadors are Jedi knights,
I believe.

28
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:39,569
I knew it.

29
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:41,850
They're here to force a settlement.

30
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:46,098
Distract them.
I will contact Lord Sidious.

31
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:47,733
Are you brain-dead?

32
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:50,579
I'm not going in there
with two Jedi.

33
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:53,533
Send a droid.

34
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,577
Is it in their nature
to make us wait this long?

35
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:02,895
No. I sense
an unusual amount of fear...

36
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:05,056
for something as trivial
as this trade dispute.

37
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:17,337
<i>What is it?</i>

38
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:20,020
This scheme of yours has failed,
Lord Sidious.

39
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:23,530
The blockade is finished.
We dare not go against these Jedi.

40
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:28,256
<i>Viceroy, I don't want
this stunted slime in my sight again.</i>

41
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:33,459
<i>This turn of events is unfortunate.
We must accelerate our plans.</i>

42
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:36,014
<i>Begin landing your troops.</i>

43
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:39,689
My lord, is that legal?

44
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:42,015
<i>I will make it legal.</i>

45
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:44,335
And the Jedi?

46
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:46,849
<i>The chancellor should never have
brought them into this.</i>

47
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:48,652
<i>Kill them immediately.</i>

48
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:52,898
Yes, my lord.
As you wish.

49
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,418
Captain, look!

50
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,819
Shields--

51
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:03,977
Sorry.

52
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:07,457
Dioxis.

53
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:14,608
<i>They must be dead by now.</i>

54
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:17,300
<i>Destroy what's left of them.</i>

55
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,375
Oh! Excuse me.

56
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,333
-Check it out, Corporal. We'll cover you.
-Roger, roger.

57
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:32,852
Uh-oh. Blast them.

58
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:39,859
What is going on down there?

59
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:41,857
We lost the transmission, sir.

60
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:49,058
Have you ever encountered
a Jedi knight before, sir?

61
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:52,013
Well, no, but I don't--
Seal off the bridge.

62
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:54,734
- Yes, sir.
- That won't be enough, sir.

63
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:56,737
I want droidekas
up here at once!

64
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:59,294
We will not survive this.

65
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:11,733
Close the blast doors!

66
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:20,170
That will hold them.

67
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:30,894
They are still coming through.

68
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,851
This is impossible!

69
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:39,899
Where are those droidekas?

70
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:43,092
Master! Destroyers!

71
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:50,579
They have shield generators!

72
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:54,574
It's a standoff.
Let's go.

73
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:00,969
They're no match for droidekas.

74
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,692
Sir!

75
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:05,380
They've gone up
the ventilation shaft.

76
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:16,380
- Battle droids.
- It's an invasion army.

77
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:20,620
This is an odd play
for the Trade Federation.

78
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:23,698
We've got to warn the Naboo
and contact Chancellor Valorum.

79
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,299
Let's split up.

80
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:28,492
Stow aboard separate ships
and meet down on the planet.

81
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:30,372
You were right
about one thing, Master.

82
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:34,820
The negotiations were short.

83
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:38,249
Sir, a transmission
from the planet.

84
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:40,371
It's Queen Amidala herself.

85
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,809
At last we are getting results.

86
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:47,018
Again you come before us,
Your Highness.

87
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:50,098
<i>You will not be so pleased when you hear
what I have to say, Viceroy.</i>

88
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:53,769
<i>Your trade boycott
of our planet has ended.</i>

89
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:56,334
I was not aware of such failure.

90
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:59,054
<i>I have word that the chancellor's
ambassadors are with you now...</i>

91
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:01,774
<i>and that you have been commanded
to reach settlement.</i>

92
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:04,050
I know nothing
of any ambassadors.

93
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:06,455
You must be mistaken.

94
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:08,491
<i>Beware, Viceroy.</i>

95
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:11,214
<i>The Federation
has gone too far this time.</i>

96
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:15,219
We would never do anything
without the approval of the senate.

97
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:17,729
You assume too much.

98
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:19,179
<i>We will see.</i>

99
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:24,574
- She's right. The senate will never--
- It's too late now.

100
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:27,533
- Do you think she suspects an attack?
- I don't know.

101
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:31,812
But we must move quickly to disrupt
all communications down there.

102
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:40,695
<i>Negotiations haven't started
because the ambassadors aren't there?</i>

103
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,890
<i>How could that be true?</i>

104
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:47,172
<i>I have assurances from the chancellor
his ambassadors did arrive.</i>

105
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:50,895
<i>It must-- handiwork--
negotiate-- ambassadors--</i>

106
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:53,534
<i>- nobody would--
- Senator Palpatine.</i>

107
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:55,457
What's happening?

108
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:57,377
Check the transmission generator.

109
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:02,130
A communications disruption
can mean only one thing: invasion.

110
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:04,455
The Federation
would not dare go that far.

111
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:08,209
The senate would revoke their trade
franchise, and they'd be finished.

112
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:11,059
We must continue to rely
on negotiation.

113
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:14,252
Negotiation?
We've lost all communications.

114
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:16,610
And where are
the chancellor's ambassadors?

115
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:20,255
This is a dangerous situation,
Your Highness.

116
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:22,371
Our security volunteers
will be no match...

117
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,536
against a battle-hardened
Federation army.

118
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:29,609
I will not condone a course of action
that will lead us to war.

119
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:07,538
<i>- Yes, Viceroy?
- Captain, we've searched the ship...</i>

120
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:09,696
<i>and there is no trace of theJedi.</i>

121
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:12,459
<i>They may have gotten on
one of your landing craft.</i>

122
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:14,935
If they're down here, sir,
we'll find them.

123
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:19,212
<i>Use caution.
TheseJedi are not to be underestimated.</i>

124
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:34,178
- Oh, no!
- Get away! Get out of here!

125
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:36,891
Get down!

126
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:49,253
Was'n dat?
Hey, wait!

127
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:51,812
Oh, mooie-mooie,
I love you.

128
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:53,896
You almost got us killed.
Are you brainless?

129
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,578
I spake.

130
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,736
The ability to speak
does not make you intelligent.

131
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:00,613
- Now, get out of here.
- No, no, mesa stay.

132
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:03,652
Mesa culled Jar Jar Binks.
Mesa your humble servant.

133
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:05,771
- That won't be necessary.
- Oh, but it 'tis.

134
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:08,653
'Tis demanded by the gods, it 'tis.

135
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:10,611
- Oh, no!
- Stay down!

136
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:20,292
You saved my again.

137
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:22,217
- What's this?
- A local.

138
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:24,774
Let's get out of here
before more droids show up.

139
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:28,131
More?
"More'' did you spake?

140
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:32,936
Ex-squeeze-me, but de mostest
safest place would be Gunga City.

141
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:36,132
Is where I grew up.
'Tis a hidden city.

142
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,497
- A city?
- Uh-huh.

143
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:41,338
Can you take us there?

144
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:43,578
On second thought, no.

145
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:46,089
- Not really, no.
- No?

146
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:48,256
'Tis embarrassing...

147
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:52,168
but my afraid
my've been banished.

148
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:55,258
My forgotten. Da bosses
would do terrible tings to me.

149
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:58,292
Terrible tings to me
if me goen back dare.

150
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:01,298
- You hear that?
- Yah.

151
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:05,015
That is the sound of a thousand
terrible things heading this way.

152
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:07,608
If they find us,
they will crush us...

153
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:12,097
grind us into tiny pieces
and blast us into oblivion.

154
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:13,858
Oh.

155
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:15,971
Yousa point is well seen.

156
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:18,330
Dis way. Hurry!

157
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:26,571
- How much further?
- Wesa goen underwater, okeyday?

158
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,497
Ah, my warning you.

159
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:32,579
Gungans no liken outsiders,
so don't spect a warm welcome.

160
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:35,897
Don't worry. This hasn't been
our day for warm welcomes.

161
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:48,209
Yousa follow me now, okeyday?

162
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:34,458
So good bein home!

163

Hey, yousa.
Stopa dare.

164
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:55,010
Heyo-dales, Cap'n Tarpals.

00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:56,937
Mesa back.

166

Noah gain,Jar Jar.
Yousa goen tada bosses.

167
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:02,494
Yousa in big dudu dis time.

00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:09,573
How wude.

169
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:20,169
Yousa cannot bees hair.

170
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:24,657
Dis army of Mackineeks
up dare is new weesong.

171
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:29,456
A droid army is about to attack
the Naboo. We must warn them.

172
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:33,016
Wesa no like da Naboo.

173
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:35,813
Da Naboo tink day so smarty.

174
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:38,738
Day tink day brains so big.

175
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:42,819
Once those droids take control of the
surface, they will take control of you.

176
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:45,135
Mesa no tink so.

177
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:48,013
Day not know of uss-en.

178
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:50,938
You and the Naboo form
a symbiont circle.

179
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:54,291
What happens to one of you will affect
the other. You must understand this.

180
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:59,016
Wesa no carrrre-nn about da Naboo.

181
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:01,574
Then speed us on our way.

182
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:04,089
Wesa ganna speed yous away.

183
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:06,893
We could use a transport.

184
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:09,739
Wesa give yousa una bongo.

185
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:12,818
Da speediest way tooda Naboo...

186
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:17,456
'tis goen through the planet core.

187
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:19,377
Now...

188
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,218
go.

189
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:23,490
Thank you for your help.
We leave in peace.

190
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:25,576
Master, what's a bongo?

191
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,577
A transport, I hope.

192
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:29,691
Deysa setten yousa up.

193
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:33,290
Goen through da planet core?
Bad bombin'.

194
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:37,413
Any help here would be hot.

195
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,497
Master, we're short on time.

196
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:44,094
We'll need a navigator to get us
through the planet's core.

197
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:46,097
This Gungan may be of help.

198
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:51,052
What is to become
of Jar Jar Binks here?

199
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:55,890
Hisen to be pune-ished.

200
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:58,099
I saved his life.

201
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:00,609
He owes me
what you call a "life-debt.''

202
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:04,415
Your gods demand
that his life belongs to me now.

203
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:06,770
Binks...

204
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:10,688
yousa havena liveplay
with thisen hisen?

205
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:18,932
Begone wit him!

206
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,775
Count me outta dis one.

207
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:26,892
Better dead here
than dead in da core.

208
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:30,012
Yee gods!
What mesa sayin?

209
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:50,173
Dis is nutsen.
Oh, gooberfish!

210
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:53,417
- Why were you banished,Jar Jar?
- It's a longo tale-o...

211
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:58,375
buta a small part of it
would be mesa... clumsy.

212
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:03,096
- You were banished for being clumsy?
- Yousa might'n be sayin dat.

213
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:19,539
Mesa caused mabee one two-y
lettle bitty axadentes, huh?

214
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:21,616
Yud-say boom da gasser...

215
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:24,413
den crashin der boss's heyblibber,
den banished.

216
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:33,371
Big gooberfish!
Huge-o teeth!

217
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:47,619
- There's always a bigger fish.
- Mesa tink we goen back now.

218
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:01,612
The invasion is on schedule,
my lord.

219
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:04,618
<i>I have the senate
bogged down in procedures.</i>

220
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:08,972
<i>They will have no choice but
to accept your control of the system.</i>

221
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:13,616
The queen has great faith
that the senate will side with her.

222
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:16,573
<i>Queen Amidala is young and naive.</i>

223
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:20,010
<i>You will find controlling her
will not be difficult.</i>

224
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,937
Yes, my lord.

225
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:26,093
You didn't tell him
about the missing Jedi.

226
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:30,532
No need to report that to him
until we have something to report.

227
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:38,409
- Where wesa goin?
- Don't worry. The Force will guide us.

228
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:41,213
Oh, maxi big, da Force.

229
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:44,011
Well, dat smells stinkowiff.

230
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:47,615
- We're losing power.
- Oh, no!

231
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,490
Wesa dyin' here.

232
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:58,180
-Just relax. We're not in trouble yet.
- What "yet''?

233
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:01,133
Monsters out dare.
Leak'n in here.

234
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:06,015
All sink'n and no power?
Whena yousa tinkin wesa in trouble?

235
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:09,455
Power's back.

236
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:11,571
Monster's back!

237
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,772
Relax.

238
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,299
You overdid it.

239
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:40,336
Head for that outcropping.

240
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:42,291
Oh, boy.

241
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:18,171
Viceroy, we have captured the queen.

242
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,860
Ah, victory.

243
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:35,890
Dis'n loverly.

244
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:44,050
How will you explain this invasion
to the senate?

245
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:48,173
The queen and I will sign a treaty that
will legitimize our occupation here.

246
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:51,337
I have assurances
it will be ratified by the senate.

247
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:54,770
- I will not cooperate.
- Now, now, Your Highness.

248
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:58,859
In time, your people's suffering will
persuade you to see our point of view.

249
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:01,971
- Commander.
- Yes, sir.

250
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,658
Process them.

251
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:05,498
Captain, take them to Camp 4.

252
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:07,178
Roger, roger.

253
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:01,936
We should leave the street,
Your Highness.

254
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:03,618
Get their weapons.

255
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:07,530
Yousa guys bombad!

256
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:11,375
We're ambassadors
for the supreme chancellor.

257
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,297
Your negotiations seemed
to have failed, Ambassador.

258
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:15,172
The negotiations
never took place.

259
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,575
It's urgent that we make contact
with the Republic.

260
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,691
They've knocked out
all our communications.

261
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:23,017
- Do you have transports?
- In the main hangar. This way.

262
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:30,738
- There are too many of them.
- That won't be a problem.

263
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:34,250
Your Highness, under the circumstances,
I suggest you come to Coruscant with us.

264
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:37,292
Thank you, Ambassador,
but my place is with my people.

265
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:40,014
- They will kill you if you stay.
- They wouldn't dare.

266
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:42,096
They need her to sign a treaty
to make this invasion legal.

267
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:43,699
They can't afford to kill her.

268
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:45,856
There is something else behind all this,
Your Highness.

269
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:47,857
There's no logic
in the Federation's move here.

270
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:49,857
My feelings tell me
they will destroy you.

271
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:52,255
Our only hope is for the senate
to side with us.

272
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:54,735
Senator Palpatine
will need your help.

273
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:58,648
Either choice presents great danger...
to us all.

274
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:00,577
We are brave, Your Highness.

275
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:03,817
If you are to leave,
Your Highness, it must be now.

276
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:06,295
Then I will plead our case
to the senate.

277
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:09,018
Be careful, Governor.

278
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:19,571
We'll need to free those pilots.

279
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:22,577
I'll deal with that.

280
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:26,889
Halt.

281
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:28,612
I'm ambassador
to the supreme chancellor.

282
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,253
I'm taking these people to Coruscant.

283
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:33,452
- Where are you taking them?
- To Coruscant.

284
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:36,094
Coruscant?
Uh, that doesn't compute.

285
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:38,051
Uh, wait.
Uh, you're under arrest.

286
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:44,449
Come on. Move!

287
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:50,530
Go!

288
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:18,211
Now, stay here
and keep out of trouble.

289
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:23,930
Hello, boyos.

290
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:31,578
There's the blockade.

291
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:43,138
The shield generator's been hit!

292
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:52,813
How wude!

293
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:03,933
We're losing droids fast.

294
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:07,254
If we can't get the shield generator
fixed, we'll be sitting ducks.

295
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:10,534
The shields are gone.

296
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:19,614
The power's back!

297
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:25,610
That little droid did it.
He bypassed the main power drive.

298
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:28,208
Deflector shields up at maximum.

299
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:40,969
There's not enough power to get us
to Coruscant. The hyperdrive is leaking.

300
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:43,853
We'll have to land somewhere
to refuel and repair the ship.

301
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:46,050
Here, Master.
Tatooine.

302
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:47,772
It's small, out of the way, poor.

303
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:49,572
The Trade Federation
have no presence there.

304
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:51,497
How can you be sure?

305
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:53,451
It's controlled by the Hutts.

306
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:56,253
You can't take Her Royal Highness there.
The Hutts are gangsters.

307
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:58,575
- If they discovered her--
- It'd be no different than landing...

308
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:00,497
on a system controlled
by the Federation...

309
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:02,611
except that the Hutts
aren't looking for her...

310
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:04,731
which gives us the advantage.

311
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:11,898
<i>And Queen Amidala,
has she signed the treaty?</i>

312
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:15,490
She has disappeared, my lord.

313
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:19,613
One Naboo cruiser
got past the blockade.

314
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:22,535
<i>I want that treaty signed.</i>

315
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:24,616
My lord...

316
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:27,174
it's impossible to locate the ship.

317
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:29,416
It's out of our range.

318
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:31,690
<i>Not for a Sith.</i>

319
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:34,057
<i>This is my apprentice...</i>

320
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:36,011
<i>Darth Maul.</i>

321
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:40,451
<i>He will find your lost ship.</i>

322
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:46,815
This is getting out of hand.

323
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:48,896
Now there are two of them.

324
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:51,898
We should not
have made this bargain.

325
00:26:56,980 --> 00:27:00,370
An extremely well-put-together
little droid, Your Highness.

326
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:03,253
Without a doubt, it saved the ship,
as well as our lives.

327
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:06,577
It is to be commended.
What is its number?

328
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:11,176
R2-D2, Your Highness.

329
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:12,653
Thank you, R2-D2.

330
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:17,653
Padmé.

331
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:21,176
Clean this droid up
as best you can.

332
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:23,177
It deserves our gratitude.

333
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:26,379
Continue, Captain.

334
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:30,972
Your Highness,
with your permission...

335
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:33,739
we're heading for a remote planet
called Tatooine.

336
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:37,057
It's in a system far beyond the reach
of the Trade Federation.

337
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:39,648
I do not agree
with the Jedi on this.

338
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:42,578
You must trust my judgment,
Your Highness.

339
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:47,498
Hello.

340
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:50,453
Sorry. Husa are yousa?

341
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:52,933
I'm Padmé.

342
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:55,931
Mesa Jar Jar Binks.

343
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:57,968
You're a Gungan, aren't you?

344
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:03,616
- How'd you end up here with us?
- My no know.

345
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:07,255
Mesa day starten pitty okeyday
witda brisky morning munchen.

346
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:10,053
Den boom!
Getten berry scared...

347
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:13,331
and grabben dat Jedi, and pow--
mesa here.

348
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:17,049
Mesa getten
berry, berry scared.

349
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:26,058
- That's it-- Tatooine.
- There's a settlement.

350
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:30,093
Land near the outskirts.
We don't want to attract attention.

351
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:49,333
The hyperdrive generator's gone, Master.
We'll need a new one.

352
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:51,815
That'll complicate things.
Be wary.

353
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:54,932
- I sense a disturbance in the Force.
- I feel it also, Master.

354
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:57,016
Don't let them send
any transmissions.

355
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:05,169
The sun doen murder to mesa skin.

356
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:06,733
Wait!

357
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:09,133
Wait.

358
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:15,173
Her Highness commands you
to take her handmaiden with you.

359
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:18,895
No more commands
from Her Highness today, Captain.

360
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:21,011
The spaceport
is not going to be pleasant.

361
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:23,176
The queen wishes it.

362
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:25,131
She's curious about the planet.

363
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:30,532
This is not a good idea.
Stay close to me.

364
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:46,499
Moisture farms,
for the most part.

365
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:51,289
Some indigenous tribes
and scavengers.

366
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:53,217
The few spaceports like this one...

367
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:55,535
are havens for those
that don't wish to be found.

368
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:57,491
Like us.

369
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:01,453
Dissen berry, berry bad.

370
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:04,418
Icky, icky goo!

371
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:19,209
We'll try one of the smaller dealers.

372
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:26,497
Good day to you.

373
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:29,419
What do you want?

374
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:32,498
I need parts for a J-type 327 Nubian.

375
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:36,499
Ah, yes! Nubian.
We have lots of that.

376
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:39,017
Boy, get in here now!

377
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:40,937
My droid has a readout of what I need.

378
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:45,052
What took you so long?

379
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:47,179
I was cleaning the fan switches.

380
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:49,939
Watch the store.
I've got some selling to do.

381
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:53,177
So, let me take thee out back, huh?

382
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:55,097
We'll find what you need.

383
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:59,138
Don't touch anything.

384
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:11,813
- Are you an angel?
- What?

385
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:15,489
An angel. I heard the deep space
pilots talk about them.

386
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:18,373
They're the most beautiful
creatures in the universe.

387
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:20,968
They live on the moons of lego,
I think.

388
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:25,255
You're a funny little boy.
How do you know so much?

389
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:29,055
I listen to all the traders
and star pilots who come through here.

390
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:33,298
I'm a pilot, you know, and someday
I'm gonna fly away from this place.

391
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:37,208
- You're a pilot?
- Mm-hmm. All my life.

392
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:39,535
How long have you been here?

393
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:43,494
Since I was very little.
Three, I think.

394
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:46,214
My mom and I were sold
to Gardulla the Hutt...

395
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:48,934
but she lost us
betting on the Podraces.

396
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:50,778
You're a slave?

397
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:54,859
- I'm a person, and my name is Anakin.
- I'm sorry.

398
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:58,575
I don't fully understand.
This is a strange place to me.

399
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:11,979
- I got ya.
- Hey!

400
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:13,772
Hit the nose.

401
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:21,650
A T-14 hyperdrive generator.
Thee in luck.

402
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:24,294
I'm the only one hereabouts
who has one.

403
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:27,776
But thee might as well buy a new ship.
It would be cheaper, I think, huh.

404
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:30,699
Saying of which...

405
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:33,095
how's thee gonna pay
for all this, huh?

406
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:35,176
I have 20,000 Republic dataries.

407
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:37,052
Republic credits?

408
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:39,978
Republic credits are no good out here.
I need something more real.

409
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:43,092
I don't have anything else,
but credits will do fine.

410
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:46,690
<i>- No, they won't.
- Credits will do fine.</i>

411
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:48,572
No, they won't!

412
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:52,693
What, you think you're some kind of Jedi,
waving your hand around like that?

413
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:56,893
I'm a Toydarian. Mind tricks
don't work on me. Only money.

414
00:32:57,700 --> 00:33:00,931
No money, no parts, no deal.

415
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:05,417
And no one else has a T-14 hyperdrive,
I promise you that.

416
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:16,093
Wouldn't have lasted long anyways
if I wasn't so good at building things.

417
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:21,497
We're leaving.Jar Jar.

418
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:26,454
I'm glad to have met you, Anakin.

419
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:28,332
I was glad to meet you too.

420
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:40,737
Outlanders.
They think we know nothing.

421
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:42,691
They seemed nice to me.

422
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:44,651
Clean the racks.

423
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:46,054
Then you can go home.

424
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:47,898
Yippee!

425
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:55,975
<i>And you're sure there's
nothing left on board?</i>

426
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:57,897
A few containers of supplies.

427
00:33:58,020 --> 00:34:00,932
The queen's wardrobe, maybe,
but not enough for you to barter with...

428
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:03,290
not in the amount
you're talking about.

429
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:06,218
All right. I'm sure
another solution will present itself.

430
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:07,659
I'll check back later.

431
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:10,012
Noah gain. Noah gain.

432
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:12,859
Da beings hereabouts, cawazy!

433
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:15,335
Wesa be wobbed un crunched.

434
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:18,497
Not likely. We have nothing of value.
That's our problem.

435
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:34,493
Are you going to pay for that?

436
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:38,217
It costs seven wupiupi.

437
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:44,574
Oops.

438
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:50,697
Is this yours?

439
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:52,492
Who, mesa--

440
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:58,536
Careful, Sebulba.

441
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:00,571
He's a big-time outlander.

442
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:04,090
I'd hate to see you diced
before we race again.

443
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:07,929
Next time we race, boy,
it will be the end of you.

444
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:10,972
If you weren't a slave,
I'd squash you now.

445
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:14,379
Yeah, it'd be a pity
if you had to pay for me.

446
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:18,452
- Hi.
- Hi there.

447
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:20,298
Your buddy here was
about to be turned into orange goo.

448
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:22,217
He picked a fight with a Dug...

449
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:24,729
an especially dangerous Dug
called Sebulba.

450
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:28,296
Mesa haten crunchen.
Das da las ting mesa want.

451
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:32,254
Nevertheless, the boy is right.
You were heading into trouble.

452
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:34,179
Thanks, my young friend.

453
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:38,177
But mesa doen nutten!

454
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:48,808
This storm will slow them down.

455
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:50,373
Looks pretty bad.

456
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:54,049
<i>- Panaka.
- Receiving a message from home.</i>

457
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:55,898
We'll be right there.

458
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:04,130
Here, you'll like these pallies.

459
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:06,728
- Here.
- Thank you.

460
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:10,055
My bones are aching.

461
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:14,537
Storm's coming up, Ani.
You better get home quick.

462
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:17,379
- Do you have shelter?
- We'll head back to our ship.

463
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,968
- Is it far?
- It's on the outskirts.

464
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:22,375
You'll never reach
the outskirts in time.

465
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:26,209
Sandstorms are very, very dangerous.

466
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:28,695
Come on.
I'll take you to my place.

467
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:43,969
Mom!

468
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:47,649
- Mom, I'm home!
- Ah, dissen cosy.

469
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:50,055
- These are my friends, Mom.
- Hello.

470
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:53,570
- I'm Qui-Gon Jinn.
- I'm building a droid. You wanna see?

471
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:55,975
Your son was kind enough
to offer us shelter.

472
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:57,977
Come on. I'll show you 3PO.

473
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:10,497
Isn't he great?
He's not finished yet.

474
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:11,848
He's wonderful.

475
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:14,698
You really like him?

476
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:17,618
He's a protocol droid
to help Mom. Watch.

477
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:23,088
Where is everybody?

478
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:24,335
Whoops.

479
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:28,535
Oh, hello.

480
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:31,811
I am C-3PO,
human cyborg relations.

481
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:33,737
How might I serve you?

482
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:36,533
- He's perfect.
- Oh. Perfect.

483
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:40,050
When the storm is over, I'll show you
my racer. I'm building a Podracer.

484
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:43,814
I'm not sure this floor
is entirely stable.

485
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:47,012
Hello. I don't believe
we have been introduced.

486
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:51,010
R2-D2.
A pleasure to meet you.

487
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:54,052
I am C-3PO,
human cyborg relations.

488
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:59,652
I beg your pardon,
but what do you mean, " naked''?

489
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:04,377
My parts are showing?
My goodness!

490
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:11,175
<i>The death toll is catastrophic.</i>

491
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:13,575
<i>We must bow to their wishes.</i>

492
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:15,656
<i>You must contact me.</i>

493
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:18,340
It's a trick.
Send no reply.

494
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:20,371
Send no transmissions of any kind.

495
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:25,333
It sounds like bait
to establish a connection trace.

496
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:29,248
<i>What if it is true,
and the people are dying?</i>

497
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:31,735
Either way,
we're running out of time.

498
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:46,856
Tatooine is sparsely populated.

499
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:49,653
If the trace was correct,
I will find them quickly, Master.

500
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:51,577
Move against the Jedi first.

501
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:54,294
You will then have no difficulty
in taking the queen to Naboo...

502
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:56,217
to sign the treaty.

503
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:58,410
At last we will reveal ourselves
to the Jedi.

504
00:38:58,540 --> 00:39:00,849
At last we will have revenge.

505
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:03,733
You have been well-trained,
my young apprentice.

506
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:06,135
They will be no match for you.

507
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:14,654
All slaves have a transmitter
placed inside their bodies somewhere.

508
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:18,578
I've been working on a scanner
to try and locate mine.

509
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:22,056
- Any attempt to escape--
- And they blow you up!

510
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:24,453
How wude!

511
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:26,889
I can't believe
there's still slavery in the galaxy.

512
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:28,817
The Republic's antislavery laws--

513
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:31,170
The Republic doesn't exist out here.

514
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:33,370
We must survive on our own.

515
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:35,773
Xcuse me.

516
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:40,214
Has anybody ever seen a Podrace?

517
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:42,058
They have Podracing
on Malastare.

518
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:44,774
Very fast, very dangerous.

519
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:47,337
I'm the only human who can do it.

520
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:50,338
You must have Jedi reflexes
if you race pods.

521
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:52,739
Don't do that again.

522
00:39:57,980 --> 00:40:00,448
You're a Jedi knight, aren't you?

523
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:06,053
- What makes you think that?
- I saw your laser sword.

524
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:08,933
Only Jedis carry
that kind of weapon.

525
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:12,052
Perhaps I killed a Jedi
and took it from him.

526
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:13,738
I don't think so.

527
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:15,930
No one can kill a Jedi.

528
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:18,696
I wish that were so.

529
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:20,776
I had a dream I was a Jedi.

530
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:23,937
I came back here
and freed all the slaves.

531
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:27,257
- Have you come to free us?
- No, I'm afraid not.

532
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:31,532
I think you have.
Why else would you be here?

533
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:38,859
I can see there's
no fooling you, Anakin.

534
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:41,858
We're on our way to Coruscant,
the central system in the Republic...

535
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:43,891
on a very important mission.

536
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:46,932
How did you end up out here
in the outer rim?

537
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:50,530
Our ship was damaged, and we're
stranded here until we can repair it.

538
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:54,812
I can help.
I can fix anything.

539
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:56,373
I believe you can.

540
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:59,173
But first we must acquire
the parts we need.

541
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:01,894
Wit no-nutten mula to trade.

542
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:05,410
These junk dealers
must have a weakness of some kind.

543
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:09,658
Gambling. Everything here revolves
around betting on those awful races.

544
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:10,974
Podracing.

545
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:13,898
Greed can be a powerful ally.

546
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:16,773
I built a racer.
It's the fastest ever.

547
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:19,095
There's a big race tomorrow
on Boonta Eve.

548
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:21,097
You could enter my pod.

549
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:24,932
- Anakin, Watto won't let you.
- Watto doesn't know I've built it.

550
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:26,857
You could make him think
it was yours...

551
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:29,096
and get him
to let me pilot it for you.

552
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:30,733
I don't want you to race.
It's awful.

553
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:33,249
I die every time
Watto makes you do it.

554
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:35,416
But, Mom, I love it.

555
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:38,930
The prize money would more than pay
for the parts they need.

556
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:41,255
Anakin.

557
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:44,019
Your mother's right.

558
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:47,098
Is there anyone friendly to the Republic
who can help us?

559
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:50,132
No.

560
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:59,457
Mom, you say the biggest problem in this
universe is nobody helps each other.

561
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:06,853
I'm sure Qui-Gon doesn't want
to put your son in danger.

562
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:08,811
We'll find some other way.

563
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:13,535
There is no other way.

564
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:17,812
I may not like it,
but he can help you.

565
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:20,457
He was meant to help you.

566
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:35,257
Are you sure about this?

567
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:37,894
Trusting our fate
to a boy we hardly know?

568
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:39,976
The queen will not approve.

569
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:41,897
The queen doesn't need to know.

570
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:44,538
Well, I don't approve.

571
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:48,134
The boy tells me you want
to sponsor him in the race.

572
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:49,818
How can you do this?

573
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:53,091
Not on the Republic credits,
I think.

574
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:55,290
My ship will be the entry fee.

575
00:42:55,780 --> 00:42:57,418
Not bad!

576
00:42:57,540 --> 00:43:00,373
Not bad, huh?
Nubian, huh?

577
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:03,651
It's in good order,
except for the parts I need.

578
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:06,169
What would the boy ride?

579
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:09,690
He smashed up my pod in the last race.
It would take some long time to fix it.

580
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:12,050
It wasn't my fault.
Really.

581
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:13,738
Sebulba flashed me with his vents.

582
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:17,091
I actually saved the pod, mostly.

583
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:20,535
That you did.

584
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:23,333
The boy's good.
No doubts there, huh?

585
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:25,849
I have acquired a pod
in a game of chance.

586
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:27,572
The fastest ever built.

587
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:32,615
I hope you didn't kill
anyone I know for it, huh?

588
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:37,890
So, you supply the pod
and the entry fee...

589
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:39,339
and I supply the boy.

590
00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:43,169
We split the winnings 50-50,
I think, huh?

591
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:45,097
If it's going to be 50-50...

592
00:43:45,220 --> 00:43:47,734
I suggest you front the cash
for the entry.

593
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:49,816
If we win...

594
00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:53,569
you keep all the winnings,
minus the cost of the parts I need.

595
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:56,772
And if we lose,
you keep my ship.

596
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:00,493
Either way, you win.

597
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:07,334
Deal!

598
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:16,413
Your friend
is a foolish one, methinks.

599
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:26,858
What if this plan fails, Master?

600
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:29,574
We could be stuck here
a very long time.

601
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:32,134
<i>Well, it's too dangerous
to call for help...</i>

602
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:35,491
and a ship without a power supply
isn't going to get us anywhere.

603
00:44:35,620 --> 00:44:37,497
And...

604
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:39,417
there's something about this boy.

605
00:44:45,980 --> 00:44:48,210
You should be very proud of your son.

606
00:44:48,940 --> 00:44:51,170
He gives without any thought
of reward.

607
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:54,053
He knows nothing of greed.

608
00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:55,215
He has--

609
00:44:56,180 --> 00:44:57,977
He has special powers.

610
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:00,849
Yes.

611
00:45:00,980 --> 00:45:03,494
He can see things
before they happen.

612
00:45:03,620 --> 00:45:06,293
That's why he appears
to have such quick reflexes.

613
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:08,217
It's a Jedi trait.

614
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:11,013
He deserves better
than a slave's life.

615
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:14,371
Had he been born in the Republic,
we would have identified him early.

616
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:20,295
The Force is unusually strong with him.
That much is clear.

617
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:22,092
Who was his father?

618
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:26,531
There was no father.

619
00:45:27,940 --> 00:45:31,137
I carried him,
I gave birth, I raised him.

620
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:34,369
I can't explain what happened.

621
00:45:35,980 --> 00:45:37,698
Can you help him?

622
00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:39,617
I don't know.

623
00:45:42,020 --> 00:45:45,490
I didn't actually come here
to free slaves.

624
00:45:58,100 --> 00:45:59,897
Wow, a real astro droid!

625
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:05,335
- How do you get so lucky?
- That isn't the half of it.

626
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:08,293
- I'm in the Boonta race tomorrow.
- What?

627
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:10,058
With this?

628
00:46:10,180 --> 00:46:12,819
You're such a joker, Ani.

629
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:16,012
- You've been working on that for years.
- It's never gonna run.

630
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:18,210
Come on.
Let's go and play ball.

631
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:21,491
Keep racing, Ani.
You're gonna be bug squash.

632
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:31,975
Keep away from
those energy binders.

633
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:35,410
If your hand gets caught in the beam,
it's gonna go numb for hours.

634
00:46:35,540 --> 00:46:36,859
Okay.

635
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:42,854
My tongue is fat.

636
00:46:42,980 --> 00:46:45,938
My tongue-- Wrench.

637
00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:48,620
Where is de wrench?
Oh, dare it is.

638
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:54,379
I'm stuck.

639
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:58,334
You know, I find that Jar Jar creature
to be a little odd.

640
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:02,819
You don't even know
if this thing's gonna run.

641
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:04,931
- It will.
- I think it's time we found out.

642
00:47:05,060 --> 00:47:07,176
- Here, use this power charge.
- Yes, sir!

643
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:09,256
Come on, Kitster.
Let's move away.

644
00:47:09,380 --> 00:47:11,496
My mouth.

645
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:12,894
Ani, I'm stuck.

646
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:19,970
My tongue is fat.

647
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:22,933
You're quite right.
He's very odd indeed.

648
00:47:25,060 --> 00:47:27,016
Thank you.

649
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:28,493
Go.

650
00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:45,890
It's working!
It's working!

651
00:47:56,100 --> 00:47:58,489
Stay still, Ani.
Let me clean this cut.

652
00:47:58,620 --> 00:48:02,374
There's so many.
Do they all have a system of planets?

653
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:04,297
Most of them.

654
00:48:04,420 --> 00:48:06,297
Has anyone been to 'em all?

655
00:48:07,940 --> 00:48:09,089
Not likely.

656
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:12,296
I wanna be the first one
to see 'em all.

657
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:15,735
Ani, bedtime!

658
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:18,499
There we are.
Good as new.

659
00:48:18,620 --> 00:48:21,373
Ani, I'm not gonna tell you again.

660
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:24,776
- What are you doing?
- Checking your blood for infections.

661
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:26,379
Go on.

662
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:28,377
You have a big day tomorrow.

663
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:30,297
Sleep well, Ani.

664
00:48:32,940 --> 00:48:34,851
<i>- Obi-Wan?
- Yes, Master?</i>

665
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:37,574
I need an analysis
of this blood sample I'm sending you.

666
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:39,338
Wait a minute.

667
00:48:40,980 --> 00:48:42,857
I need a midi-chlorian count.

668
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:48,214
The reading is off the chart.

669
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:50,137
Over 20,000.

670
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:53,730
<i>Even Master Yoda doesn't have
a midi-chlorian count that high.</i>

671
00:48:53,860 --> 00:48:55,578
No Jedi has.

672
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:57,656
What does that mean?

673
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:00,058
I'm not sure.

674
00:50:07,140 --> 00:50:09,893
I wanna see your spaceship
the moment the race is over.

675
00:50:10,020 --> 00:50:11,692
Patience, my blue friend.

676
00:50:11,820 --> 00:50:13,970
You'll have your winnings
before the suns set.

677
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:15,818
And we'll be far away from here.

678
00:50:15,940 --> 00:50:19,819
Not if your ship belongs to me,
I think, huh?

679
00:50:19,940 --> 00:50:23,171
I warn you, no funny business.

680
00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:26,292
- You don't think Anakin can win?
- Don't get me wrongo.

681
00:50:26,420 --> 00:50:28,775
I have great faith in the boy.

682
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:30,936
He's a credit to your race...

683
00:50:31,060 --> 00:50:34,132
but Sebulba there
is going to win, I think.

684
00:50:36,180 --> 00:50:37,852
Oh, no!

685
00:50:41,860 --> 00:50:43,612
Why do you think that?

686
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:45,537
He always wins!

687
00:50:47,460 --> 00:50:49,815
I am betting heavily on Sebulba.

688
00:50:51,580 --> 00:50:54,174
- I'll take that bet.
- What?

689
00:50:54,900 --> 00:50:58,097
I'll wager my new racing pod
against, say...

690
00:50:58,220 --> 00:51:00,017
the boy and his mother.

691
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:03,689
No pod is worth two slaves,
not by a long shot.

692
00:51:04,580 --> 00:51:06,252
The boy, then.

693
00:51:12,220 --> 00:51:14,609
We'll let fate decide, huh?

694
00:51:14,740 --> 00:51:18,016
I just happen to have
a chance cube here.

695
00:51:18,140 --> 00:51:21,052
Blue, it's the boy.

696
00:51:21,180 --> 00:51:22,249
Red...

697
00:51:23,620 --> 00:51:25,178
his mother.

698
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:36,809
You won this small toss,
outlander...

699
00:51:36,940 --> 00:51:38,976
but you won't win the race!

700
00:51:39,100 --> 00:51:41,091
So it makes little difference!

701
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:55,210
Better stop your friend's betting
or I'll end up owning him too.

702
00:51:58,820 --> 00:52:01,209
- What'd he mean by that?
- I'll tell you later.

703
00:52:01,340 --> 00:52:02,659
Good morning.

704
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:07,339
Oh, my.
Space travel sounds rather perilous.

705
00:52:09,340 --> 00:52:13,174
I can assure you, they will never get me
onto one of those dreadful starships.

706
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:16,531
This is so wizard, Ani.
I'm sure you'll do it this time.

707
00:52:16,660 --> 00:52:17,695
Do what?

708
00:52:17,820 --> 00:52:20,732
Finish the race, of course.

709
00:52:20,860 --> 00:52:22,532
You've never won a race?

710
00:52:22,660 --> 00:52:25,254
Well, not exactly.

711
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:27,291
Not even finished?

712
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:29,775
Kitster's right.
I will this time.

713
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:31,856
Of course you will.

714
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:02,052
That's absolutely right.

715
00:53:02,180 --> 00:53:07,015
And a big turnout here from all corners
of the outer rim territories.

716
00:53:07,140 --> 00:53:10,610
I see the contestants are making
their way out onto the starting grid.

717
00:53:12,620 --> 00:53:15,339
<i>I see Ben Quadinaros
from the Tund System.</i>

718
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:23,135
<i>Two-time winner Boles Roor.</i>

719
00:53:25,580 --> 00:53:27,298
<i>Sebulba!</i>

720
00:53:37,300 --> 00:53:40,258
And in the front row,
nearside pole position...

721
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:42,291
<i>Mawhonic!</i>

722
00:53:43,460 --> 00:53:45,416
<i>A hearty hello...</i>

723
00:53:45,540 --> 00:53:49,089
<i>to Clegg Holdfast
and his Voltec KT9 Wasp!</i>

724
00:53:51,980 --> 00:53:54,858
<i>And back again,
it's the mighty Dud Bolt...</i>

725
00:53:54,980 --> 00:53:59,371
<i>with that incredible racing machine,
the Vulptereen 327.</i>

726
00:54:02,580 --> 00:54:04,775
<i>And hoping for a big win today...</i>

727
00:54:04,900 --> 00:54:09,132
<i>Ody Mandrell,
with his record-setting pit droid team.</i>

728
00:54:13,820 --> 00:54:16,937
<i>And a late entry,
young Anakin Skywalker...</i>

729
00:54:17,060 --> 00:54:18,288
<i>a local boy.</i>

730
00:54:20,900 --> 00:54:23,050
I see the flags are moving
out onto the track.

731
00:54:42,460 --> 00:54:43,939
Be safe.

732
00:54:44,060 --> 00:54:46,290
I will, Mom. I promise.

733
00:55:01,820 --> 00:55:04,380
You won't walk away from this one...

734
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:06,650
you slave scum.

735
00:55:06,780 --> 00:55:09,897
Don't count on it, slime ball.

736
00:55:10,020 --> 00:55:12,295
You're bantha fodder!

737
00:55:16,700 --> 00:55:18,816
- You all set, Ani?
- Yep.

738
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:20,498
Right.

739
00:55:24,460 --> 00:55:26,974
Remember, concentrate
on the moment.

740
00:55:27,100 --> 00:55:30,695
Feel, don't think.
Use your instincts.

741
00:55:30,820 --> 00:55:32,378
I will.

742
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:34,616
May the Force be with you.

743
00:55:43,220 --> 00:55:45,131
Jabba the Hutt.

744
00:55:54,940 --> 00:55:59,172
Welcome.

745
00:56:00,100 --> 00:56:03,217
Begin the race!

746
00:56:13,340 --> 00:56:16,377
<i>Hey, looks like
they're clearing the grid.</i>

747
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:19,337
- Is he nervous?
- He's fine.

748
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:23,653
You Jedi are far too reckless.
The queen is not--

749
00:56:23,780 --> 00:56:26,533
The queen trusts my judgment,
young handmaiden.

750
00:56:26,660 --> 00:56:28,776
You should too.

751
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:30,891
You assume too much.

752
00:56:31,620 --> 00:56:33,929
<i>Start your engines.</i>

753
00:57:11,620 --> 00:57:14,817
Oh, dissen gonna be messy.
Me no watch'n!

754
00:57:34,020 --> 00:57:35,248
Oh, no!

755
00:57:40,660 --> 00:57:43,811
Wait.
Little Skywalker has stalled.

756
00:57:53,860 --> 00:57:57,899
<i>It looks like Quadinaros
is having engine trouble also.</i>

757
00:57:59,420 --> 00:58:00,648
Come on, Ani!

758
00:58:06,820 --> 00:58:08,333
<i>And there goes Skywalker!</i>

759
00:58:08,460 --> 00:58:09,859
Go, Ani, go!

760
00:58:09,980 --> 00:58:12,016
<i>He will be hard-pressed
to catch up with the leaders.</i>

761
00:59:23,100 --> 00:59:25,898
<i>Looks like a few Tusken Raiders
are camped out...</i>

762
00:59:26,020 --> 00:59:28,215
<i>on the canyon dune turn.</i>

763
00:59:38,980 --> 00:59:42,529
There goes Quadinaros'
power coupling.

764
01:00:09,140 --> 01:00:11,256
Oh, no!

765
01:00:15,860 --> 01:00:17,657
Where is Master Anakin?

766
01:00:20,780 --> 01:00:22,896
Look. Here he comes.

767
01:00:25,660 --> 01:00:27,890
<i>It looks like Skywalker
is moving up in the field.</i>

768
01:00:28,740 --> 01:00:30,093
Yay! Yippee!

769
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:40,736
He has to complete
two more circuits? Oh, dear.

770
01:01:45,580 --> 01:01:47,377
Skywalker's
spinning out of control!

771
01:02:42,940 --> 01:02:46,728
I don't care what universe you're from.
That's gotta hurt!

772
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:55,138
Here he comes!

773
01:02:55,260 --> 01:02:58,252
<i>At the start of the third and final lap,
Sebulba's in the lead...</i>

774
01:02:58,380 --> 01:03:00,769
<i>followed closely by Skywalker!</i>

775
01:03:00,900 --> 01:03:01,730
Go, Ani!

776
01:03:27,660 --> 01:03:29,890
Skywalker's been forced
onto the service ramp!

777
01:03:50,700 --> 01:03:52,019
It's Skywalker!

778
01:03:52,940 --> 01:03:54,214
Sebulba!

779
01:03:54,340 --> 01:03:58,413
Amazing! A quick control thrust,
and he's back on course!

780
01:03:58,540 --> 01:04:00,212
Did he crash-ed?

781
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:42,572
Skywalker's in trouble!
Sebulba takes the lead!

782
01:05:33,420 --> 01:05:35,012
He's catching Sebulba!

783
01:05:36,100 --> 01:05:38,489
Careful, Ani. Careful, Ani!

784
01:06:07,620 --> 01:06:09,895
That little human being
is out of his mind!

785
01:06:10,980 --> 01:06:12,095
<i>They're side by side!</i>

786
01:06:39,580 --> 01:06:41,377
- Yippee!
- Yay!

787
01:06:45,420 --> 01:06:47,058
I can't believe it.

788
01:06:47,180 --> 01:06:49,011
